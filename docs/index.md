# GFM-RAG Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for GFM-RAG project.

## Overview

The GFM-RAG is the first graph foundation powered RAG pipeline that combines the power of graph neural networks to reason over knowledge graphs and retrieve relevant documents for question answering.

We first build a knowledge graph index (KG-index) from the documents to capture the relationships between knowledge. Then, we feed the query and constructed KG-index into the pre-trained graph foundation model (GFM) retriever to obtain relevant documents for LLM generation. The GFM retriever experiences large-scale training and can be directly applied to unseen datasets without fine-tuning.

## Features

- **Graph Foundation Model (GFM)**: A graph neural network-based retriever that can reason over the KG-index.
- **Knowledge Graph Index**: A knowledge graph index that captures the relationships between knowledge.
- **Efficiency**: The GFM-RAG pipeline is efficient in conduct multi-hop reasoning with single step retrieval.
- **Generalizability**: The GFM-RAG can be directly applied to unseen datasets without fine-tuning.
- **Transferability**: The GFM-RAG can be fine-tuned on your own dataset to improve performance on specific domains.
- **Compatibility**: The GFM-RAG is compatible with arbitrary agent-based framework to conduct multi-step reasoning.
- **Interpretability**: The GFM-RAG can illustrate the captured reasoning paths for better understanding.
